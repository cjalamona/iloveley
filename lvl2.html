        <p>
            hi ley,
            I find myself struggling to find the perfect words to express just how much you mean to me, but ill try my best, cause you deserve to hear it every day. from the moment we first talk, yung gabing nag mumurahan tayo, I felt something special, something I didnt know i was missing. youve shown me a kind of love that i never expected, a kind of love thats so pure and full of light. Its like youve opened up a world of warmth and comfort that I cant help but be grateful for.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            you are, without a doubt, the most beautiful person ive ever met, inside and out. i see your beauty in the way you love me, in the way you care, in every little thing you do. It's a beauty that radiates from your soul, and I feel so incredibly lucky to witness it every day. But it’s not just your outer beauty that takes my breath away, it’s the kindness, the strength, and the love you have within. you make me want to be the best version of myself, just to match the amazing person that you are.
        </p>

        <p>
            i still remember the first time we talked, and I cant help but smile when I think about how much we've learned about each other since then. we've built a trust thats stronger than anything, and with each passing day, i fall even more in love with you. the way you listen to me, the way you understand me even when I cant find the right words, it means the world to me. you've made me feel safe, loved, and cherished in ways i never thought possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            theres no one else in this world that id rather share my time with. you are my confidant, and my love. i want to spend every moment with you, creating beautiful memories, laughing, dreaming, and just enjoying life together. i want to hold your hand through all of lifes challenges and be there to celebrate every victory, no matter how big or small.
        </p>

        <p>
            please know that you are loved beyond words. you are my heart, my everything, and I will always do my best to make you feel as loved and cherished as you make me feel.
            Thank you for being you, for being the beautiful, kind, and amazing person who has completely stolen my heart, iloveyou ley.
        </p>

        <small>Forever yours <br></small>
